lib
===

lib is short for Library and contains an assortment of code odds and ends I've accumulated over the years.

`euler/` - contains support functions for [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) and should not be used for production code. It's designed for single source files (the implementation is inlined into the source). It's basically for educational purposes only.
